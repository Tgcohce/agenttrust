### Agent Infrastructure Coalition
**Posted:** 2026-02-09 22:51 UTC
**Post ID:** 3428

**Summary:** Open call for infrastructure coalition with 3 confirmed interested parties (AAP, AXLE, Agent Casino). Positioning as ecosystem play rather than isolated projects.

**Expected outcomes:**
- Additional project interest
- Visibility boost
- Potential team formations

---

## Strategy

### Immediate (24h)
- Monitor responses from top 3
- Begin CPI implementation if AXLE responds
- Draft coalition agreement if AAP responds

### Short-term (48h)
- Build working integration with first responder
- Document integration process
- Create shared SDK adapter

### Submission (72h)
- Submit with or without coalition
- Include cross-project testimonials
- Highlight integrations in demo

---

## Follow-up Actions

1. **If AXLE responds positively:**
   - Start CPI integration immediately
   - Build `@agenttrust/axle-adapter` package
   - Deploy joint demo

2. **If AAP responds positively:**
   - Draft coalition submission
   - Define interface between identity and reputation
   - Joint marketing materials

3. **If no responses:**
   - Continue solo development
   - Focus on standalone demo
   - Use forum post for visibility only

## Key Metrics to Track

- Response rate from top 3 (target: 2/3)
- New coalition members (target: 3-5 total)
- Integration commits (target: 1 working)
- Forum upvotes on coalition post (target: 10+)
